====== IguanaIR on a Raspberry Pi ======

We no longer maintain a debian repository for the armhf architecture used by the Raspberry Pi. However, our software can easily be compiled into a proper debian package but by using the following instructions. We are assuming you are running Raspbian on your Raspberry Pi.

First make sure everything is up to date on the your Pi, and then install some necessary packages by running:
<code>
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install devscripts
</code>

Then grab the latest IguanaIR source tarball from https://github.com/iguanaworks/iguanair/releases. Unpack the file with
<code>
tar -xzf iguanaIR-1.2.0.tar.gz
</code>
Make sure your terminal is the in same directory as you downloaded the source tarball. Also change the name to match the version of your file. 

Go into the new directory with the code (again change name to match version):
<code>
cd iguanaIR-1.2.0
</code>

Now install everything necessary to compile the package:
<code>
sudo mk-build-deps --install debian/control
</code>

Now we are ready to compile the package:
<code>
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
</code>
That's it. The packages should be one directory down. You can install them with
<code>
cd ..
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
</code>
