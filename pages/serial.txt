 === Will your device work with a USB->Serial Adapter? ===

No. It will not. Our serial device does not talk RS232, as required by USB->Serial adapters, and doesn't even use the Transmit (TX) and Receive (RX) pins, but the DCD and DTR lines. Why? That's the standard for the LIRC serial devices (see [[http://www.lirc.org/transmitters.html|Serial Port Transmitters]] and [[http://www.lirc.org/receivers.html|Serial Port Receivers]] if you really want all the details).
