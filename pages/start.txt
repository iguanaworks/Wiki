===== USB IR Transceiver =====

The IguanaWorks USB IR Transceiver is a simple USB device that can communicate with most home electronics and remote controls via infrared (IR).  The transceiver can both send and receive IR codes, and is fully compatible with [[http://www.lirc.org/|LIRC]] under Linux and [[http://winlirc.sourceforge.net/|WinLIRC]] under windows.  Unlike serial devices, the USB transceiver does not require a kernel module, and multiple transceivers can be in use at the same time.  Each transceiver can transmit on up to 4 independent channels (dual socket version only). The transmitter is high-power compared to most serial devices, with a range of 10 ft.  We support [[http://www.lirc.org/|LIRC]] and [[http://winlirc.sourceforge.net/|WinLIRC]]. Basic overview and purchasing information available [[http://iguanaworks.net/products/usb-ir-transceiver/|here]].
