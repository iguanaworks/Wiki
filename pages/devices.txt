====== Known Good Devices ======

These devices are known to be compatible with the IguanaWorks USB transceiver.  This list is not exhaustive; it just contains examples that have been tested by us or people we know.  Any device that works with LIRC should be ok, but we'll keep adding devices to this list until we're certain that we support any device LIRC supports.  Let us know what works for you and we'll add it to the list.
